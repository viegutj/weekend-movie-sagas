## Description


This project was an exploration into using redux sagas and relational databases. I learned how to use some advanced SQL syntax and how to organize my app's state management with redux-saga.

Additional README details can be found [here](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/readme-template/blob/master/README.md).
